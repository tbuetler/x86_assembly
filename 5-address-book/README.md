# 5-address-book Program an Address Book in C

## Overview and Goal
The goal of this project is to write a library containing functions to manipulate an address book. The functions are declared in the file 'addr_book_lib.h' . This file contains also the definitions of the structs that are to be used.

You have to implement the functions in the file 'addr_book_lib.c'. In this file you must implement all the functions that are presented. They are tested in the file 'addr_book_test.c'.



## Expected Output

You do not have the right to change both files 'addr_book_lib.h' and 'addr_book_test.c'.

You have to implement the functions inside the file 'addr_book_lib.c'.

The tests must all return 0. If it is not the case, the test will not work.
